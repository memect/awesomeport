http://alex.smola.org/
Alexander J. Smola. I studied physics in Munich at the University of Technology, Munich, at the Universita degli Studi di Pavia and at AT&T Research in Holmdel. During this time I was at the Maximilianeum MÃ¼nchen and the Collegio Ghislieri in Pavia. In 1996 I received the Master degree at the University of Technology, Munich and in 1998 the Doctoral Degree in computer science at the University of Technology Berlin. Until 1999 I was a researcher at the IDA Group of the GMD Institute for Software Engineering and Computer Architecture in Berlin (now part of the Fraunhofer Geselschaft). After that, I worked as a Researcher and Group Leader at the Research School for Information Sciences and Engineering of the Australian National University. From 2004 onwards I worked as a Senior Principal Researcher and Program Leader at the Statistical Machine Learning Program at NICTA. From 2008 to 2012 I worked at Yahoo Research. In spring of 2012 I moved to Google Research to spend a wonderful year in Mountain View.
Research interests: Scalability of algorithms. This means pushing algorithms to internet scale, distributing them on many (faulty) machines, showing convergence, and modifying models to fit these requirements. For instance, randomized techniques are quite promising in this context. In other words, I'm interested in big data.
Kernels methods are quite an effective means of making linear methods nonlinear and nonparametric. My research interests include support vector Machines, gaussian processes, and conditional random fields. Kernels are very useful also for the representation of distributions, that is two-sample tests, independence tests and many applications to unsupervised learning. Statistical modeling, primarily with Bayesian Nonparametrics is a great way of addressing many modeling problems. Quite often, the techniques overlap with kernel methods and scalability in rather delightful ways.
Applications, primarily in terms of user modeling, document analysis, temporal models, and modeling data at scale is a great source of inspiration. That is, how can we find principled techniques to solve the problem, what are the underlying concepts, how can we solve things automatically.

Computational Perspectives on Social Phenomena in On-Line Networks will be Jonâs speech. With an increasing amount of social interaction taking place in the digital domain, and often in public on-line settings, we are accumulating enormous amounts of data about phenomena that were once essentially invisible to us: the collective behavior and social interactions of hundreds of millions of people, recorded at unprecedented levels of scale and resolution. Analyzing this data computationally offers new insights into the design of on-line applications, as well as a new perspective on fundamental questions in the social sciences. We discuss how this perspective can be applied to questions involving network structure and the dynamics of interaction among individuals, with a particular focus on the ways in which evaluation, opinion, and in some cases polarization manifest themselves at large scales in the on-line domain.
